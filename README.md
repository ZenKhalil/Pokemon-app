# Pokemon-app by Mohammed-Zen

This is a school project, made using Javascript as the code language. It also contains CSS and html files as well.

It contains a list of pokemon objects that can be viewed with more details in a dialog box if pressed on.

The list is also sorted by name in alphabetical order for an easier UI experience.

Feel free to use it as a Pokedex.
